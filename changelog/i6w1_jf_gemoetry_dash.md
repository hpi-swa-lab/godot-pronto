# Iteration 6 Week 1 - Geometry Dash

We want to foucs on following functionality from the original game:

- Simple Cube: Press space to jump (casual mechanic)
- Plane: hold space to gain altitude, else lose altitude
- Gravity Change: Pressing space inverts gravity
- Gravity Effect: Gravity of the level is switched, player still jumps
- "Ufo": player can jump in the air (like flappy bird)

A somewhat showcase of these can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvq9UTK0GPQ&t=288s).

In both our game and the original, the introduction of a new mechanic happens whenever the player reaches a "portal".

Within the default mode we also added following interactions:

- Air Launcher: When touched, the player is launched into the air.
- Mid Air jump: Yellow circle that allows the player to jump mid air when inside.
