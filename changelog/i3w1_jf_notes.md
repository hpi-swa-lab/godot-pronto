# I3W1 - Super Mario Snake and other moving obstacles

## What feature did we miss in pronto

It would be nice to assign the value of a `Value`-Behavior to things like the `duration_seconds` of the Clock (like `at("ClockDuration")`). This would help with trying out different values for such properties.

When trying out `Spawners` in a different szene (than the main szene) it seems to cause some errors to occur.

## Where did we use code

We used code to set the timer durations to the value of the value sliders in order to try out different values by using the `PrototypingUI`. We also used code for the snake to move (TODO: Maybe use always here as well in combination with `Code`-Behavior).
